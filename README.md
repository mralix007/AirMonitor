# AirQuality Monitoring System
An air quality monitoring system provides real-time data on air quality and its toxicity levels. This system employs sensors to continuously measure various air pollutants, displaying the current air quality status, including the concentration of harmful substances like particulate matter or gases. By offering up-to-date information, it helps individuals and authorities stay informed about the quality of the air they breathe, enabling them to take appropriate actions to protect their health and the environment.
